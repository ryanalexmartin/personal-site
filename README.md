# Ryan Alex Martin

Sorry for the boring page.  Right now, this is literally just a Markdown file hosted on GitHub. 

I'm currently busy building stuff for my AI startup, [Nazar](https://nazar-ai.com).
We are building AI computer vision tools for semiconductor factories in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

Once I have some more time, I'll update this page to add some info about the countless projects (both for work and pleasure) I've worked on over the past few years.

You can find me on GitHub at @ryanalexmartin.

Thanks to all of my family, friends, and colleagues who have supported me throughout the years, I love you all.



# Why I am deleting LINE even though I live in Taiwan

LINE is cancerous adware that just does not respect its users.  When I see that glowing green square light up with the ominous red notification dot of doom, I get a panic attack every time.  

Using LINE to support customers is a bad idea.  If you have a customer on LINE they will send you messages all throughout the night, and the more unread messages that accumulate, the more anxiety and stress the app will cause you, because it's not designed to protect your mental health, LINE is not designed to facilitate anything other than absolute integration into Taiwanese society to constantly track you, collect your data, and deliver you ads, and influence your views and opinions.

Taiwanese people are going to think I'm crazy for deleting it, but these tech companies just have waaaay too much hold over our psyches.  I won't be part of this growing problem any more.

I deleted my Instagram a while back and it's been super great for my mental health, I don't miss it at all.  I'm sure I'll miss LINE even less.

The YouTuber Ceylan talks about it here too:
