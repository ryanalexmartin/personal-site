# Ryan Alex Martin

Sorry for the boring page.  Right now, this is literally just a Markdown file hosted on GitHub. 

I'm currently busy building stuff for my AI startup, [Nazar](nazar-ai.com).
We are building AI computer vision tools for semiconductor factories in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

Once I have some more time, I'll update this page to add some info about the countless projects (both for work and pleasure) I've worked on over the past few years.

You can find me on GitHub at @ryanalexmartin.

Thanks to all of my family, friends, and colleagues who have supported me throughout the years, I love you all.
